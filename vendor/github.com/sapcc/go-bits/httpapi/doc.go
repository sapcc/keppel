// Package httpapi contains opinionated base machinery for assembling and
// exposing an API consisting of HTTP endpoints.
//
// The core of the package interface is the Compose() method, which creates a
// single http.Handler serving any number of HTTP APIs, each implemented as a
// type satisfying this package's API interface.
//
// Compose() creates a single router that encompasses all API's endpoints, and
// adds a few middlewares on top that apply to all these endpoints.
//
// # Logging
//
// For each HTTP request served through this package, a plain-text log line in a
// format similar to nginx's "combined" format is written using the logger from
// package logg (by default, to stderr) using the special log level "REQUEST".
//
// To suppress logging of specific requests, call SkipRequestLog() somewhere
// inside the handler.
//
// # Metrics
//
// Each HTTP request counts towards the following histogram metrics:
// "httpmux_first_byte_seconds", "httpmux_response_duration_seconds",
// "httpmux_request_size_bytes" and "httpmux_response_size_bytes".
//
// The buckets for these histogram metrics, as well as the application name
// reported in the labels on these metrics, can be configured if
// ConfigureMetrics() is called before Compose(). Otherwise, a default choice of
// buckets will be applied and the application name will be read from the
// Component() method of package github.com/sapcc/go-api-declarations/bininfo.
